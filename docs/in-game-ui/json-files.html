<h1>Json files related to in-game UI</h1>
<p>
    The in-game UI is modified mainly by changing the widgetui folder, which contains a bunch of jsons and the inner folder Textures, which contains the image files used for the sprites.
</p>

<h2>
    Non modifiable UI
</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <u>Tooltip:</u>
        <p>When you hover a button, like create a villager button, a tooltip appears. That tooltip doesn't have a corresponding json file, so it can't be modded. The user can choose between "Off", "Floating" and "Fixed", as well as the scale.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p> 
    
</p>
<p>
    It would be nice to be able to move the fixed tooltip position so that is not in the way of other UI elements.

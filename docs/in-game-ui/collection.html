<h2>
    Collection
</h2>
<p>
    Every UI json file starts with a collection (which is a collection of widgets). Collections are pretty standard. They usually only have the attributes Name, Viewport and Widgets, though sometimes they can have a longer list (see command panel below).
</p>
<p>
	 In my experience, the name of the collection can't be renamed, otherwise it will not render. The name tends to be the filename but with UpperCamelCase.

<h1>Note to devs</h1>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p> This section contains ideas that could make modding easier/better. Right now I only got 1. I am not going to judge how easy or hard it would be to implement these features, since I do not know how the game is built.</p>
<h2>New widget type: Deadzone</h2>
<p>Allowing us to create a deadzone widget would make it posible for us to reimagine completly how the UI works. The map could be put on blankbottompanel.json if we wanted, seperating it from the map buttons. We could, also, separate the command panel left and right, since we would be able to add the deadzone required by command panel right. </p>
<p>Personally, I would like to have a vertical command panel on the left with the map buttons and menu buttons over there also aligned vertically. Right now it is imposible, but this change would enable it, just like it would enable a lot of possibilities, </p>
